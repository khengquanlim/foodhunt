# i. The user is asked to enter his/her location on NTU campus according 2D coordinates (row, column) if distance is a concern.
# ii. The user is asked to enter his inquiry criteria
# iii. The recommendation information displayed

# 1. Decomposition: (implement as major functions):
    # a. Information system set up, pre-store some information
    # b. Display the map to user
    # c. Allow user to update information
    # d. User inputs inquiry and get recommendation
    # e. Sort based on distance, price, or rank
# 2. Programming style with proper comments
# 3. Testing: Correctness of your solution.
# 4. Optional or advanced feature:

#Get user location either though console input or mouse click
def get_user_location():
    pass

#The function calculate the distance between two points.
def distance_a_b (location_of_a,location_of_b):
    pass

#Display the sorted distances from userâ€™s current location to each canteen in ascending order.
def sort_distance(user_location,canteens_location):
    pass

#Search all canteens to return the canteen with wanted food

def sort_by_rank(ranklist_canteens):
    pass

#Search all canteens to return the food within the searched range
def Search_by_price(price,foodlist_canteens):
    pass

#To return coordinate of a mouseclick
def Mouseclick():

#allow use to get transport information from current location to the destination
