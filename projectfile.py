# i. The user is asked to enter his/her location on NTU campus according 2D coordinates (row, column) if distance is a concern.
# ii. The user is asked to enter his inquiry criteria
# iii. The recommendation information displayed

# 1. Decomposition: (implement as major functions):
    # a. Information system set up, pre-store some information
    # b. Display the map to user
    # c. Allow user to update information
    # d. User inputs inquiry and get recommendation
    # e. Sort based on distance, price, or rank
# 2. Programming style with proper comments
# 3. Testing: Correctness of your solution.
# 4. Optional or advanced feature:
